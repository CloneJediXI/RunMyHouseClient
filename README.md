# RunMyHouseClient
COSC 481 Project Client

This project was created using React Native. 
Many files are simply there to facilitate the mounting of the project. 
The source files I wrote are electron-app/src/App.js, and everything in the directory electron-app/src/components/

Run the app in development mode by going into the folder 'electron-app' and running the command 'npm run dev'

Added a new line for work in progress
